        <p>The Word "UYIR"
            UYIR is a unique word in the classic language Tamil meaning life or soul, the divine spirit or energy which
            makes the universe to be alive.

            <p>Our Story
                The practice of using chemicals and pesticides in agricultural fields is killing millions of living beings
                across the globe and particularly in India after the Green revolution. We, a few farmers from Erode, a town
                in Tamilnadu, India decided to bring about a change in the society by producing and supplying natural
                food products to the people to reduce the risk of getting disease/illness/disorders by consuming the
                chemicals/pesticides which are used in the agriculture farms. In this process, we formed the "Uyir
                Organic Farmers Society" in the year 2015.
